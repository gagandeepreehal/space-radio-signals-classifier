# Cosmic Radio Signal Classifier

We used Keras with TensorFlow as its backend to solve an image classification problem. The data we used consists of 2D spectrograms of deep space radio signals collected by the Allen Telescope Array at the SETI Institute. We treated the spectrograms as images to train an image classification model to classify the signals into one of four classes. We built and trained a convolutional neural network from scratch using Keras to classify signals from space.
